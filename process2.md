DCF Key generation -> 
In DCF, the evaluation process involves
comparing a public input x âˆˆ  Z_2^n to a private value a.

 F 1) Generate input shares
 F 2) Send the input shares
 F 3) Wait for the model share, the no. of MTs to generate, and the Beaver's multiplication triples prevalues 
SF 4) Generate enough MTs to calculate the first layer
 N 5) Calculate the first layer
SF 6) Generate more MTs until a new message is received or enough MTs were generated
